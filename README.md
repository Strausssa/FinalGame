My game is hangman/make the word

This game is made to test your ability to make words with any letter.

Hope you guys enjoy the game!


How to Play:

1)Open up Command Prompt or Git Bash

2)Run "main.rb"

3)You will be given a blank word with empty spaces where you will need to put letters into. This is done by typing a letter.

4)Guess and the word will update

5)Once you guess all the letters, you will win.

You only have 5 chances more than the word length. Example, if the word has 6 blanks, you have 11 tries to complete the word.

6)Good luck and have fun!

---------------------------------------------------
My Game is:

-Very original with the fact that no one has a similar game like mine.

-Has occurred many problems that had to be overcomed including:

1) Making it so it picks a random word which I solved through making a txt file with thousands apon thousands of words.

2) Making it so a single letter can show up more than once in a word which was solved through checking each letter in an array.

3) Making it so there is a certain number of chances for the word which was made through given 5 chances plus the word length of the array.

-Is easily changable with the fact you can change the number of chances per a word and the word list.

-Makes for a good learning opportunity where you can learn new words that you never heard or used before.
