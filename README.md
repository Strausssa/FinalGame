My game is hangman/make the word
This game is made to test your ability to make words with any letter.
Hope you guys enjoy the game!

How to Play:
1)Open up Command Prompt or Git Bash
2)Run "main.rb"
3)You will be given a blank word with empty spaces where you will need to put letters into. This is done by typing a letter.
4)Guess and the word will update
5)Once you guess all the letters, you will win.
You only have 5 turns more than the word length. Example, if the word has 6 blanks, you have 11 tries to complete the word.
6)Good luck and have fun!
